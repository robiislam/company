			<h1 id="d">Service Virtualization: Tailored to Improve Your Software Development Process</h1>

			<p>In 2018, service virtualization goes mainstream. According to the recent statistics, more and more small companies adopt virtual desktop solutions which is no surprise — service virtualization offers huge relief to small businesses by changing the way IT resources are managed.</p>

			<p>Service virtualization solutions are especially beneficial for people, working in the area of software development — they provide first-class performance, unmatched flexibility, and efficient utilization by allowing to move server workloads from one virtual workspace to another, maximizing server resources based on client’s business needs. In addition to that, server virtualization services are often applied to reduce testing costs, enhance productivity, and deploy better quality software in a shorter period.
			</p>
			<p>Thinking about implementing service virtualization into your own business? Then, you have come to the right place. <b>R2JM</b> offers a wide variety of virtual desktop solutions for small and mid-sized companies in Portland, Oregon. No matter which one you select for your business, you can be sure you are going to get a great deal.
			</p>
			<h3>Back to Basics: What Is Virtualization All About?</h3>
			<p>Service virtualization is a sophisticated technique that enables organizations to simulate and efficiently manage test environments, thus bringing quality software to the market faster and at a lower cost. In simple words, service virtualization is a computer-generated simulation of a software product with all necessary elements integrated. It's also worth mentioning that the original product may be under development or in a live deployment.
			</p>
			<p>When it comes to virtualization, you better understand the difference between server and service virtualization. First one sets up only the server virtually. With server virtualization, it becomes way more comfortable to study the behavior of connected elements and components in a demo version than in a live environment.
			</p>
			<p>While the second one, service virtualization, is all about replicating any interaction between the product and the server. Service virtualization creates live copies of original product deployment scenarios, making it easier for QA teams to identify failures and issues that would have occurred when the product goes live for users.
			</p>
			<h1 id="e">Hardware as a Service</h1>
			<p>In the business world, it is of crucial importance to provide services at a high level. The continuity does matter if you are concerned about your customers’ satisfaction.
